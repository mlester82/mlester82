- 👋 Hi, I’m @mlester82
- 👀 I’m interested in a number of things ranging from the typical reading, family, and church, to chess, amateur (ham) radio, playing bagpipes, and, well, just about anything else I come across.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something new every day. I work in cybersecurity so I have no choice.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on where ever your needs cross a skill I have.
- 📫 How to reach me ... there are physical addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and a handful of radio frequencies.
